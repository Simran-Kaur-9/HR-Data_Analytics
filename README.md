employ them let them go depending on the performance during the improvement
program. <br>
e. Emp. Sat: Employee satisfaction score – rating given by the employee on how much they
are satisfied with their employment with the company. The survey is conducted once a

rating of 5 means that the employee is highly satisfied. However, it is noticed that the
employees very rarely gave a score of 1 or 2 <br>
